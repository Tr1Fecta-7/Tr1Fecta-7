### Hi there, I'm Jalil Faquiri or Tr1Fecta! 👋

I'm a 21-year-old Software Engineering student from the Netherlands, currently pursuing my fourth year at the HvA/Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS), and following a minor/study-abroad exchange program at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for the Fall '24 and Winter '25 semesters. Ever since I was young, I've had a strong passion for technology, which eventually led me to the world of coding.

Aside from coding, I'm into photography and traveling. I intend to travel the world when I graduate from university. 


#### 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies. Here are a few things I've recently been focusing on:

- **Languages**: I'm familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, Kotlin, Objective-C, GoLang, Python, SQL, and Java.
- **Future Goals**: Get better at Math

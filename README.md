### Hi there, I'm Jalil Faquiri or Tr1Fecta! üëã

I'm a 19-year-old Software Engineering student from the Netherlands, currently pursuing my second year at the HvA/Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences (AUAS). Ever since I was young, I've had a strong passion for technology, which eventually led me to the world of coding.

Aside from coding, I'm into sneakers, photography and traveling. I intend to travel the world when I graduate from university.
